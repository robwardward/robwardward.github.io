                <div class="quote indent">We go to the cinema in order to suspend for a moment our usual modes of communication.</div>
                <div class="quotesource">-Felix Guattari</div>
                <div>A political battle has unfolded and continues to unfold around cinema for control of the effects of subjectivation and desubjectivation that the “non-human” semiotics of the cinematographic image produce on the individuated subject. The three preverbal senses of self, the sense of a verbal self, and semiotics (at once asignifying, symbolic, and signifying) are mobilized by cinematographic machinism which by deterritorializing the image and perception (the “film-eye”) risks undoing, in its way, the unity of the subject. </div>
                <div>With the cinema, we have a textbook case of how the signifying machine comes to neutralize, order, and normalize the action of symbolic and asignifying semiotics which exceed dominant significations. By hierarchizing the latter through signifying semiotics, the film industry functions like group psychoanalysis, powerfully aiding in the con- struction of the roles and functions and, especially, in the fabrication of the individuated subject and his unconscious.</div>
                <div>Guattari lists precisely the semiotics at work in the cinema:</div>
                <div class="indent">—the phonic fabric of expression that refers to spoken language (signifying semiology);</div>
                <div class="indent">—the sonorous but non-phonic fabric that refers to instrumental music (asignifying semiotics);</div>
                <div class="indent">—the visual fabric that refers to painting (both symbolic and asignifying semiotics);</div>
                <div class="indent">—the gestures and movements of the human body, etc. (symbolic semiologies);</div>
                <div class="indent">—the duration, movements, breaks in space and time, gaps, sequences, etc., that make up asignifying “intensities.”<span class="citenum">1</span></div>
                <div>The cinema, whose effects derive above all from its use of asignifying symbolic semiotics (“linkages, internal movements of visual images, colors, sounds, rhythms, gestures, speech, etc.”<span class="citenum">2</span>) represented for a brief moment the possibility of moving beyond signifying semiologies, of bypassing personological individuations, and opening up possibilities that were not already inscribed in dominant subjectivations.</div>
                <div>Film images cannot be directly encoded, marked out, and framed by the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes that ensure the relative stability and invariance of meanings as in language. With cinema, it becomes possible to rediscover the features of pre-signifying semiotics in a post-signifying world. The cinema does not put two components of expression (signifier/signified) into play, but rather, as in primitive societies, “n”: the images, sounds, and words spoken and written (texts), movements, positions, colors, rhythms, and so on. Depending on the component that prevails, there are different modalities of reading and seeing a film. “It can be seen through its colors or rhythms, through its images, through the chain of affects it creates, and there is absolutely no univocal, necessary, or unmotivated relationship between a signifying chain and the contents signified.”<span class="citenum">3</span></div>
                <div>As in primitive societies, images (symbolic semiotics) and intensities, movements, intervals, temporalities, and velocities (asignifying semiotics) reintroduce ambiguity, uncertainty, and instability into denotation and signification. Expression once again becomes polyvocal, multidimensional, and multireferential. “The semiotic components of film glide by each other without ever fixing or stabilizing themselves in a deep syntax of latent contents or in transformational systems that would lead, superficially, to manifest contents.”<span class="citenum">4</span></div>
                <div>The same impossibility of formalizing filmic language is analyzed by Pasolini. For the Italian poet, the cinema as well as an important part of human reality and of things themselves are expressed through systems of signs, in other words, by nonverbal (images or “im-signs”) and non-human “languages.” Images from memory and dream all have the features of film sequences, they are “almost prehuman events, or on the border of what is human. In any case, they are pregrammatical and even premorphological (dreams take place on the level of the unconscious, as do mnemonic processes).”<span class="citenum">5</span></div>
                <div>The cinema is at once “fundamentally oneiric” and a “hypnotic monstrum.” The “irrational” elements of the language of film, “barbarous, irregular, aggressive, visionary,” cannot be eliminated; thus the difficulty in establishing an “institutional film language.”<span class="citenum">6</span> Indeed, these features, which Pasolini terms “irrational,” make up the modalities of expression of affects, intensities, velocities, etc., whose functioning depends on a logic other than that of the individuated subject’s rationality.</div>
                <div>The cinema is thus capable, if for only an instant, of making us “orphans: single, amnesiac, unconscious, and eternal,” and removing us from the social divisions of labor that assign us a role, a function, and a meaning.<span class="citenum">7</span></div>
                <div>The intensities, movements, and duration of film images can produce effects of desubjectivation and disindividuation in the same way that childhood, drugs, dreams, passion, creation, or madness can strip the subject of his identity and social functions. Cinema suspends perception and the habitual coordinates of vision, making the sensorimotor system malfunction. Images and movements no longer depend on the movement of the object nor on the brain; instead, they are the automatic products of a machinic apparatus. In turn, montage disrupts the links between ordinary situations, images, and movements by compelling us to enter into different space-time blocs.</div>
                <div style="height: 110vh"></div>
                <div>But instead of eluding dominant subjectivations, film images can, conversely, chain us to them. They are only focal points of subjectivation. As vectors of subjectivation, they can only trigger, initiate, or open processes of heterogenesis (both the production of heterogeneity and processual genesis). The consistency of subjective heterogeneity depends on the interplay of a multiplicity of forces, apparatuses, and techniques. It depends, in the final analysis, on a politics and an aesthetics. The ethico-political battle, which the American cultural industry has resoundingly won, has been fought over this focal point of heterogeneity. The industry has worked to neutralize and stifle heterogeneity by exploiting, like psychoanalysis, personological and familialist signifiers.</div>
                <div style="height: 20vh"></div>
                <div>The shift of cinema’s multireferential and polysemic semiotics toward dominant values and the domestication of the “oneiric monster” and its “irrational elements” have occurred through the reduction of symbolic semiologies and asignifying semiotics to the models of capitalist subjectivity.</div>
                <div style="height: 30vh"></div>
                <div>The commercial cinema is “undeniably familialist, Oedipian, and reactionary. [...] Its ‘mission is to adapt people to the models required by mass consumption.”<span class="citenum">8</span> If it is incapable of establishing as invariable and stable significations as language, it can still produce models of subjectivity that have the force of examples, the obviousness of physical presence. Cinema acts on the depths of subjectivity because it provides subjectivity with identities and models of behavior by exploiting asignifying and symbolic semiotics. In this way, it functions like “group psychoanalysis,” normalizing intensities, hierarchizing semiotics, and confining them within the individuated subject.</div>
                <div style="height: 25vh"></div>
                <div>Commercial cinema’s effect on the unconscious is even more powerful than that of psychoanalysis, since its unconscious, “populated by cowboys and Indians, cops and robbers” (in other words, a non-Oedipal consciousness, an unconscious equal to the world around us), and the range of semiotic mechanisms it mobilizes “directly connect with the spectator’s processes of semiotization.”<span class="citenum">9</span></div>
                <div style="height: 25vh"></div>
                <div>The effect produced by commercial cinema and in turn by television has nothing to do with ideology, for it does not involve reflexive consciousness and representation.</div>
                <div style="height: 30vh"></div>
                <div>“All its irrational, elementary, oneiric, and barbaric elements were forced below the level of consciousness; that is, they were exploited as subconscious instruments of shock and persuasion”<span class="citenum">10</span> by the cultural industry and industry in general.</div>
                <div style="height: 50vh"></div>
                <div>Consciousness-raising is not a sufficient response because images affect us and organize themselves in direct relation with the three “selves” preceding the linguistic self. Asignifying, symbolic semiotics do not act on consciousness but rather directly on “the continuous variation and force of existing and potential action.</div>
                <div style="height: 100vh"></div>
                <div>Here, subjectivity has nothing to do with Althusser’s ideological apparatuses, because it, and especially its components, are produced as a whole, bringing to bear what I call asignifying elements, which provide the basis for relations to time, rhythms, space, the body, colors, and sexuality.<span class="citenum">11</span></div>

                    <br/>Wait, please. Excitement.
                    <br/>I don’t hear any excitement
                    <br/>about Spaghetti and meatballs!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>you’ve wasted your time with acting.
                    <br/>you’re quitting.
                    <br/>the world comes to an end tomorrow
                    <br/>night.
                    <br/>I made great sacrifices
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Tea. Sure.
                    <br/>Like some milk or sugar in that?

                    <br/>Acting’s everything to me.
                    <br/>About passion for
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;acting.
                    <br/>acting’s a whim,
                    <br/>I should forget it.
                    <br/>it’s a whim for your conviction
                    <br/>and your passion.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>I’m trapped
                    <br/>in room 111.
                    <br/>a poem I wrote for you.
                    <br/>I can’t care. I love you.
                    <br/>you’re crazy.
                    <br/>All I’m asking you to do is listen.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>The heavens made a girl
                    <br/>With hair and skin of gold.
                    <br/>To touch her would be paradise.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Seize the day!
                    <br/>Beautiful baby.
                    <br/>You’re so cute.
                    <br/>I’m trying to fix this.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Getting red? What does that mean?
                    <br/>It’s an Indian warrior symbol
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;virility.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;Makes me feel potent,

                    <br/>
                    <br/>The girls
                    <br/>coming here and killing you.
                    <br/>I love you. I’ll walk.
                    <br/>To a play? Are you kidding?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>I’ll stay away forever.
                    <br/>I promise. I’ll bow out.
                    <br/>I am that merry wanderer,
                    <br/>a roasted crab
                    <br/>And when she drinks, against her lips
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;I pour the ale,
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;telling the saddest tale,
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;for love and courtesy
                    <br/>Lie in human modesty
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Here’s your crown.
                    <br/>If shadows have offended,
                    <br/>you have slumber’d here
                    <br/>While visions did appear.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>I thought you were wonderful!
                    <br/>You have the gift. What a
                    <br/>performance You left even me speechless.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Oh, my God!
                    <br/>Oh! No!
                    <br/>Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.
                    <br/>It’s so beautiful.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>All my life
                    <br/>Thy light shall surely follow me
                    <br/>And in God’s house forevermore
                    <br/>My dwelling place shall be
                    <br/>The death is a tragedy.
                    <br/>And he will be missed.
                    <br/>Twice.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>We’re all fried.
                    <br/>Think about it.
                    <br/>They need a scapegoat.
                    <br/>We’re the victims.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>I have a detailed description.
                    <br/>for reckless and self-
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;indulgent behavior.
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;blatant abuse of death.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Read that carefully.
                    <br/>Sign the paper.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>We the Romantics.
                    <br/>What about the Realists?
                    <br/>I believe most of that.
                    <br/>What is poetry?
                    <br/>Come.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>To fully understand
                    <br/>poetry, we must first be rendered
                    <br/>&emsp;&emsp;and objective?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>the poem’s perfection
                    <br/>the poem’s greatness
                    <br/>the poem plotted
                    <br/>on the horizontal of a graph
                    <br/>
                    <br/>It’s true.
                    <br/>I do believe you.
                    <br/>Thank you. Thank you.
