        <p>At first, I wanted to speak to my father.<br/> It's probably the closest I've come to "leaving a space empty so that God could rush…" into my writing.<br/> Not that I believe.<br/><br/> I found that I had "no use in a centre" because he doesn't have one.<br/> Once I accepted that he was never going to make sense to me I started to feel at ease with writing in blankness and silence,<br/> in the hope that some part of him would find a way into my work.<br/><br/> But maybe that's the thing about leaving spaces: there's no knowing who will accommodate them in our absence.<br/><br/> In those places between emptiness I found echoes of you.<br/> Your presence became swollen, hung heavy from my words like a placenta.<br/><br/> I tried to find the balance between your weight and my own.<br/><br/> The "unhomely" way we reflect each other.<br/><br/>When I speak of an unhomely reflection I mean that moment of strangeness when the boundaries between you and me become more blurred and confused.<br/><br/>My own 'I' is brought out into the open, reflected from you, and the boundaries between us fall away.<br/><br/>It is interesting how, while writing this, I have in my own work created a space where the private and the public merge into one another.

        <p>I have many memories of gazing at my reflection as a young child.<br/>In windows, mirrors, or any shiny surface.<br/><br/>With this comes the recollection of your voice.<br/><br/>"Stop looking at yourself in the mirror."<br/><br/>"Why do you keep looking at your reflection?"<br/>Much later in my life I snorted some DMT and looked into a mirror.<br/><br/>My face was an infinite golden palace, an eternal opening of window after window.<br/>My long, brown hair turning into thick tree trunks.<br/><br/>I held onto the bathroom sink for dear life.<br/><br/>My best friend, Molly, came back home after I came down.<br/>I told her about my experience, sniffing agressively between each breath.</p>

        <p>This reminded me of a passage from Lacan's essay on the mirror stage:<br/><br/>"the formation of the <em>I</em> is symbolised in dreams by a fortress, or a stadium – its inner arena and enclosure, sur- rounded by marshes and rubbish tops, dividing it into two opposed fields of contest where the subject flounders in quest of the lofty, remote inner castle whose form... symbolises the id in quite a startling way."<br/><br/>The mirror is so important in our development because it is our first way to establish a connection between the "<em>Innenwelt</em>" and the "<em>Umwell</em>".<br/><br/>Our way of understanding that our inner world is separate from the world around us.<br/><br/>It is our first realisation of ourselves being an 'other' to something.<br/><br/>The <em>I</em> comes into being through our association with an image outside ourselves which presents to us the duplicity of our existence; that we can both be inside and outside at the same time.<br/><br/>It is the moment of fragmentation.<br/><br/>The <em>I</em> which comes out of this rupture is how we compensate for not being completely inside all the time.<br/><br/>I find it interesting to entertain the idea that this endless window palace surrounded by nature which I saw was my <em>I</em>.<br/>That this <em>I</em> was reflecting into the mirror while the mirror was reflecting it.<br/>That my mind had created its own mise-en-abyme to represent my ego.<br/><br/>Not that a hallucination can be reflected of course.</p>

        <p>Winnicot begins his essay 'Mirror-role of Mother and Family in Child Development' with this sentence:<br/><br/>"In individual emotional development <em>the precursor of the mirror is the mother's face</em>."<br/><br/>The importance of this is highlighted by the fact that at four months a baby can see faces "at nearly adult levels, even while other images are still being analyzed in lower levels of the visual system."<br/><br/>The face of the parent is, quite simply, the first image that an infant will see as itself.<br/><br/>This will be the case until the baby begins to distinguish the world into the "not-me" and the "me".<br/><br/>The mother's face comes before the mirror, meaning that, the mirror symbolically reflects the mother for the child in adulthood.<br/><br/>"When the average girl studies her face in the mirror she is reassuring herself that the mother-image is there."<br/>The mirror then doesn't just reflect the mother but becomes a way for the child to connect to the mother.</p>

        <p>This picture intrigues me because of the point of views show between the three subjects:<br/><br/>1) You<br/>2) Me<br/>3) Not-me<br/><br/>The picture is of my reflection meaning that you were looking at it when you took it.</p>

    <div class="page landscape" id="p15">
        <p>The reflection wears a look of familiarity whilst looking towards the side.<br/><br/>Even though my reflection isn't looking at me, the mirror is still acting as a perception of me.<br/>This is what the picture captures: the act of being perceived by a mirror.<br/><br/>But here I am looking at, and favouring, another mirror instead.<br/>You: my mother.<br/><br/>"When I look I am seen, so I exist."<br/>It is only when we see ourselves as distinct from the world around us that we understand we exist.<br/>After the all-encompassing world without inside or out emerges the <em>I</em>.</p>
